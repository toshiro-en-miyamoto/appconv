            P1. Inherit the behaviors and appearnces rather than the source code.</h3>
        <p class="reason">
            <strong>Reason</strong>
            The primary aim of application conversions is to 
            reimplement behaviors and appearances of the application
            rather than to rewrite the legacy logics with a different 
            programming language. 
        </p>
        <p class="example-good">
            <strong>Example, good</strong>
            Copy behaviors and appearances such as: 
            <ul>
                <li>how GUI screens are organized</li>
                <li>how GUI screens and gudgets look like</li>
                <li>how GUI gudgets respond</li>
                <li>how printed sheets look like</li>
                <li>how APIs available for external systems respond</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="example-bad">
            <strong>Example, bad</strong>
            Don't bring the dark past such as: 
            <ul>
                <li>how components/modules of the application are organized</li>
                <li>how variables/classes and subroutines/methods are organized</li>
                <li>how lines of code represent logic</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            <strong>Example</strong>
            It is preferable to redesign database layouts in synch with 
            the new programming design, but you have to inherit the
            legacy layouts when: 
            <ul>
                <li>other systems access the database</li>
                <li>data migration is going to cost you</li>
            </ul>
            If the legacy layouts must be brought to the new application, 
            you might want to 
            <ul>
                <li>design new layouts anyway, then</li>
                <li>implement a wrapper layer to absorb the differences
                    between the legacy layouts and new one.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            P2: At the very beginning, specify behaviors and appearances 
            of the target application.</h3>
        <p class="reason">
            <strong>Reason</strong>
            Without a comprehensive understanding of 
            behaviors and appearances of the target application, 
            you cannot copy them into the new application.
        </p>
        <p class="example-good">
            <strong>Example, good</strong>
            Start a conversion project 
            by preparing a compreheinsive set of testcases to 
            fully specify behaviors and appearances of the target application. 
            Advantages of having such testcases include: 
            <ul>
                <li>the Test Driven Development can be employed</li>
                <li>you don't have to write detail design documents
                    (only if stakeholders agree)</li>
                <li>the testcases can be used in the test phase
                    to prove that the new application behave as 
                    the same way as the legacy one. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            Note that some design documents are required to write 
            including but not restricted to 
            <ul>
                <li>GUI screen hierarchy diagrams</li>
                <li>component diagrams</li>
                <li>datastore layouts</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            <strong>Example</strong>
            There might exist some specification documents of the target application. 
            However, many long-lived applications have been modified and enhanced 
            without updating its specification documents accordingly, so that 
            documents (even if any) cannot be fully trusted. 
            Thus, you will end up with conducting some level of expemental operations  
            with the application to know behaviors and appearances of the application. 
            Why not leave the experiments in documents as testcases? 
        </p>
        <p class="example">
            <strong>Example</strong>
            Some projects may manually analyse source code files of the target 
            application to specify its behaviors and appearances in documents. 
            However, many long-lived applications are likely to be all patchwork 
            due to fixing bugs by commenting out old lines and 
            squeezing new functionalities between lines. 
            Thus, you may find it hard to understand the target application 
            only by reading through its source code, and may have to 
            conduct some level of expemental operations to see how the 
            application behaves. 
            Why not leave the experiments in documents as testcases?
